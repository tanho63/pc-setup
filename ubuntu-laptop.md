# Linux Laptop Adventures

This page will document setting up my new Framework Laptop with Ubuntu 21.04 ðŸŽ‰ (KDE)

I'm extremely excited about [Framework](https://frame.work/) and the idea of a modern, repairable, modular laptop - the ethos is awesome! I think it's a great opportunity to embrace the independence and also go with a Linux install instead of Windows - if this goes well enough I'll probably start dualbooting Windows/Linux on my main desktop also ðŸ¤“

I'll live stream this on Twitch: [https://twitch.tv/tanho_](https://twitch.tv/tanho_) and possibly post a recording afterwards

## Linux Distro

Going with [Kubuntu 21.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hirsute/release/) - Ubuntu 21.04 looks like the most compatible version of Ubuntu at the moment (21.10 is slightly too bleeding edge to make for a smooth install for a first-time Linux desktop user, may upgrade afterwards if Framework Community reviews improve). 

KDE looks most-similar to Windows, is pretty configurable, and comes with some decent looking (if somewhat silly-named - Dolphin? Konsole? really?) utilities, and has really nice reviews. 

I might enjoy this enough to try Manjaro/Arch someday but I'll give this a go first to get my feet wet. I'm no stranger to Linux `servers` so I think I'll be comfortable navigating desktop and terminal modes.
