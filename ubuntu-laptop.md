# Linux Laptop Adventures

This page will document setting up my new Framework Laptop with Ubuntu 21.04 ðŸŽ‰ (KDE)

I'm extremely excited about [Framework](https://frame.work/) and the idea of a modern, repairable, modular laptop - the ethos is awesome! I think it's a great opportunity to embrace the independence and also go with a Linux install instead of Windows - if this goes well enough I'll probably start dualbooting Windows/Linux on my main desktop also ðŸ¤“

I'll live stream this on Twitch: [https://twitch.tv/tanho_](https://twitch.tv/tanho_) and possibly post a recording afterwards. 

## Parts/Specs

Framework DIY edition

- CPU/iGPU: Intel i7-1165G7
- RAM: 1x16GB DDR4-3200 
- SSD: 500GBWD_BLACK SN750
- WiFi: Intel AX210 (no vPro)
- Expansion cards: 2x USB-A, 2x USB-C
- Power Adapter

Total cost: $1688.50 CAD before tax, $1908.01 CAD after tax

## Hardware Setup

Guide here: https://guides.frame.work/Guide/Framework+Laptop+DIY+Edition+Quick+Start+Guide/57

Guide was great - the wifi module was a tad finicky but getting out some tweezers helped me hold the antenna cables in a consistent position/angle, and then it worked pretty smoothly from there!

## Linux distro: Kubuntu 21.04

Going with [Kubuntu 21.04](http://cdimage.ubuntu.com/kubuntu/releases/hirsute/release/): 

- Ubuntu 21.04 looks like the most compatible version of Ubuntu at the moment per Framework Community forums, because 21.10 is slightly too bleeding edge to make for a smooth install for a first-time Linux desktop user. May upgrade afterwards if Framework Community reviews improve. 
- KDE looks most-similar to Windows, is (reportedly) very configurable, and comes with some decent looking (if somewhat silly-named - Dolphin? Konsole? really?) utilities, and has really nice reviews. 

I might enjoy this enough to try Manjaro/Arch someday but I'll give this a go first to get my feet wet. I'm no stranger to Linux `servers` so I think I'll be comfortable navigating desktop and terminal modes.

## OS install

Straightforward enough with Ubuntu 21.04 install guides from framework https://community.frame.work/t/ubuntu-21-04-on-the-framework-laptop/2722

## Fingerprint reader setup

Fingerprint install was frustrating, eventually did the (admittedly dumb) "trust a user on the internet" thing and just installed from https://github.com/cfsmp3/linux_framework_laptop/tree/master/fingerprint_reader, which mostly worked. I did have to disable log-on-with-fingerprint and now it's mostly useful within sudo, which is also fine by me.

## Mouse configs
Logitech Triathlon mouse drivers - inistalled [logiops](https://github.com/PixlOne/logiops) with `sudo snap install logiops` and then configured all the gestures myself. Gestures here: [https://github.com/tanho63/pc-setup/blob/main/logiops.cfg] and mostly a holdover from what I use on Windows also. 

## Install R/RStudio

https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu/ for the base R installation (but remembered to take r-base-dev also!)

RStudio via https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/#rstudio-desktop was also straightforward enough
