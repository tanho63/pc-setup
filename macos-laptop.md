# MacOS

New work laptop, new setup notes! My first ever with MacOS so this may be ... interesting. 

Garrick's notes are what inspired me to start logging in the first place, so it'll be nice to have someone else's to refer to for a change :)

- [install notes](https://gist.github.com/gadenbuie/a14cab3d075901d8b25cbaf9e1f1fa7d)

I'll also probably broadly follow some of my past notes too.
